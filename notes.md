I learned that I need to log into my original github account and do this all over again.
But really I learned about how cool github is to be able to make changes and create a uniform coding space across all of my devices. I can always use git pull to get the latest changes and then it is always
saved in the cloud which is really convenient.

git commit ALWAYS HAS MESSAGE
